# AGGRESSIVE COWS PROBLEM
Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000)   stalls. The stalls are located   along a straight line at positions x1,â€¦,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).

His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, FJ wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

## Approach to solve the problem:- 
1.It is a classical problem of searching  so we use binary search in it because of it nlogn complexity rather than n^2 complexity of linear search which would take  more time.


2.so we have to apply  binary search  here .
